# diffpes Theory and Architecture Guides

These guides describe the physics and software architecture of diffpes.
diffpes uses JAX for differentiable Angle-Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy
(ARPES) simulations.

## Target Audience

These guides support **physics researchers** who work with ARPES and want to
understand:

- The photoemission physics at each simulation level
- Electronic-structure data flow through the simulation pipeline
- The physical meaning of simulation parameters and outputs
- Differentiability for inverse recovery of band-structure parameters

## Guide Overview

## Quick Start

For hands-on examples, see the [tutorials](../tutorials/index.md).

## Mathematical Notation

The guides use these symbols:

- $\mathbf{k}$ for wavevectors (in $\text{Å}^{-1}$)
- $E_B$ for binding energy and $E_F$ for the Fermi level (in eV)
- $h\nu$ for photon energy (in eV)
- $(n, l, m)$ for orbital quantum numbers
- $\theta$ for polar emission angle
- $\phi$ for azimuthal angle
- $\Sigma(\omega)$ for the electron self-energy

GitHub and MathJax render the equations from compatible LaTeX notation.
