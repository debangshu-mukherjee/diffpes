# Certified forward models

diffpes certification is a scientific-assurance record for one execution of a
forward model. It records the model, semantic conventions, normalized inputs,
and ordered transformations. It also records validity checks, derivative
evidence, information losses, and the policy outcome for an observable.

Certification does **not** assert universal model correctness or input
artifact truthfulness. The recorded model domain, checks, evidence, and
numerical tolerances bound a statement such as "validated under
`org.diffpes.policy.research.v1`."

## The JAX-native assurance path

The scientific part of certification executes through the same JAX program as
the ordinary forward model. Contract predicates are array functions. Domain
margins and residuals remain differentiable leaves. JVPs and VJPs compute the
information-flow evidence. The discrete pass/fail fields show views of those
continuous quantities.

This separation matters during optimization. A policy can report a point
outside a verified photon-energy domain. The algebraic domain margin can still
supply a useful gradient toward the domain. Likewise, a small VJP reports
local first-order insensitivity at the evaluation point. It does not prove
global independence.

diffpes performs filesystem discovery and persistence outside the JAX
program. These operations cannot satisfy physics, numerical, or
differentiability claims.

## What a certificate records

A {class}`~diffpes.types.ForwardCertificate` contains:

- a versioned forward-model specification and execution manifest;
- source and normalized-artifact references;
- semantic conventions and validity-domain predicates;
- an ordered provenance graph with preserved, introduced, and destroyed
  information;
- claims with continuous margins and references to supporting evidence;
- derivative, structural-dependency, local-sensitivity, and information-spectrum
  diagnostics;
- the evaluated policy report and any unmet requirements.

The graphs answer different questions and remain distinct. Provenance records
the process that produced a result. Structural dependency records which input
leaves occur in the traced program. JVP/VJP evidence records local first-order
information flow. Transformation records identify preserved or lost
interpretations. Examples include absolute intensity calibration after
normalization and high-frequency structure after convolution.

## Certification levels

A named policy recomputes levels from claims. A stored `certified=True` flag
does not define a level.

| Level | Bounded meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `identified` | The certificate identifies the model, inputs, conventions, environment, and output. |
| `validated` | Required contracts and in-domain runtime checks passed. |
| `differentiable` | The evaluator computed the declared derivatives, which met their evidence tolerances. |
| `verified` | Required analytic or external-reference comparisons passed. |
| `benchmarked` | A named independent model or dataset comparison passed in its declared domain. |
| `reproducible` | Resolver-backed re-execution met the recorded reproduction tolerance. |

`failed`, `not_checked`, `not_applicable`, and `out_of_domain` remain visible on
individual claims. A waiver explains an unmet policy requirement; it never
turns the corresponding claim into a pass.

## Inspection

The inspection API answers scientific questions without loading the result
arrays:

```python
from diffpes.certify import (
    diff_certificates,
    explain_claim,
    summarize_certificate,
)

print(summarize_certificate(certificate))
print(explain_claim(certificate, "claim.output.finite"))
comparison = diff_certificates(reference, candidate)
```

`diff_certificates` separates scientific model, input, transformation,
evidence, numerical, environment, and audit-time differences. The comparison
therefore distinguishes a timestamp-only rerun from a model or convention
change.

## Portable records

Canonical JSON is the authoritative portable representation. The serializer
stores numeric arrays losslessly with dtype and shape metadata. It does not
round arrays into decimal lists. HDF5 stores the exact JSON record and several
convenience attributes next to a numerical result:

```python
from diffpes.inout import (
    attach_certificate_h5,
    load_certificate_h5,
    load_certificate_json,
    save_certificate_json,
)

save_certificate_json(certificate, "run.certificate.json")
restored = load_certificate_json("run.certificate.json")

attach_certificate_h5("spectrum.h5", "spectrum", certificate)
restored_from_h5 = load_certificate_h5("spectrum.h5", "spectrum")
```

The record includes a consistency marker that detects accidental storage
mismatches. This bookkeeping value provides no security, authenticity, or
physical-validity claim. The loader rejects unknown schema major versions.
It retains unknown minor extension data in the certificate extension object.
A load and save cycle therefore preserves that data.

## Reading claims responsibly

A certificate can establish that the declared implementation used the
recorded inputs. It can also establish that the implementation met named tests
in a declared domain. It cannot assess an approximation for an unrecorded
experiment. It cannot prove that an upstream DFT file or instrument file is
truthful. Local Jacobian rank cannot establish global identifiability. Those
conclusions require upstream evidence and scientific judgment.
