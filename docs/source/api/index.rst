API Reference
=============

JAX-based differentiable ARPES simulation package.

diffpes provides a differentiable pipeline connecting electronic band
structure to Angle-Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES) spectra.
Built on JAX and Equinox, the same forward physics that maps band
structures to spectra also supports gradient-based inverse recovery of
band-structure parameters from measured spectra, at six levels of
physical sophistication from basic Gaussian convolution to full
polarization-dependent dipole matrix element calculations.

:mod:`diffpes.inout`
    VASP file parsers (POSCAR, EIGENVAL, KPOINTS, DOSCAR, PROCAR, CHGCAR),
    HDF5 persistence, and plotting helpers for ARPES simulation input.

:mod:`diffpes.certify`
    JAX-native certified forward execution, provenance, evidence, policy
    evaluation, information-flow diagnostics, and inspection.

:mod:`diffpes.maths`
    Angular matrix elements for dipole photoemission: Gaunt coefficients,
    real spherical harmonics, and dipole matrix element assembly.

:mod:`diffpes.radial`
    Differentiable radial primitives: spherical Bessel functions, atomic
    radial wavefunctions, and fixed-grid radial integrals.

:mod:`diffpes.simul`
    ARPES simulation functions at six complexity levels, plus broadening,
    cross sections, polarization, and orbital angular momentum.

:mod:`diffpes.tightb`
    Native tight-binding model construction, diagonalization, and
    ARPES-side adapters for external electronic-structure sources.

:mod:`diffpes.types`
    PyTree-compatible data structures and factory functions for crystal
    geometry, bands, projections, and simulation parameters.

:mod:`diffpes.utils`
    Mathematical utilities: the Faddeeva function and z-score
    normalization.

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

    import diffpes as dp

    context = dp.simul.load_vasp_context("vasp_output_dir")
    spectrum = dp.simul.simulate_context(context)

Notes
-----

All computations are JAX-compatible and support automatic differentiation
for gradient-based recovery of band-structure parameters from measured
ARPES spectra.
