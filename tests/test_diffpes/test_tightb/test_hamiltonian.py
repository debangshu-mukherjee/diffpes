"""Tests for tight-binding Hamiltonian builder.

Extended Summary
----------------
Validates the k-space Hamiltonian construction function
``build_hamiltonian_k`` and the two built-in model factories
``make_1d_chain_model`` and ``make_graphene_model``.  Tests verify
Hermiticity of H(k), correct matrix shape, JIT compatibility, the
analytically known cosine dispersion of the 1D chain, the eigenvalue
bandwidth [-2|t|, 2|t|], the graphene Gamma-point eigenvalues (+/-3|t|),
the Dirac-point degeneracy at K=(2/3, 1/3, 0), and differentiability of
eigenvalues with respect to hopping parameters.
