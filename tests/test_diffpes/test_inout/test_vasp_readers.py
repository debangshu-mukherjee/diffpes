"""Tests for VASP file readers.

Extended Summary
----------------
Exercises the VASP file parsing API: read_doscar, read_eigenval,
read_kpoints, read_poscar, and read_procar. Each reader is tested
against minimal but valid fixture files under fixtures/ so that
parsing logic, shape construction, and numeric values can be
asserted without external data. Tests cover Line-mode, Automatic,
and Explicit KPOINTS; VASP4 and VASP5 POSCAR formats; and
multi-k-point EIGENVAL and label-extraction branches in KPOINTS.
All test logic is documented in the docstrings of each class
and test method.
