"""Tests for ARPES cross-section weight functions.

Extended Summary
----------------
Exercises heuristic_weights and yeh_lindau_weights. Heuristic tests
verify the two-regime model (p-enhanced below 50 eV, d-enhanced above),
output shape (9,), and JIT compatibility. Yeh-Lindau tests verify
interpolation at a fixed photon energy, output shape, and non-negative
weights. All test logic and assertions are documented in the docstrings
of each test class and method.
