"""Tests for momentum resolution broadening.

Extended Summary
----------------
Validates :func:`diffpes.simul.resolution.apply_momentum_broadening`, which
convolves a 2D ARPES intensity map along the k-axis with a Gaussian kernel
to simulate the finite angular/momentum resolution of an electron analyser.
Tests cover the identity limit (dk -> 0), the smoothing effect on a
delta-like peak, approximate conservation of total intensity, output shape
preservation, and differentiability of the broadening width parameter via
``jax.grad``.

    Validates the Gaussian momentum-broadening convolution applied along

    intensity conservation (since the Gaussian kernel is normalized),
    shape preservation, and JAX differentiability with respect to the

        Notes
        -----
        1. **Setup**: Create a uniform intensity map of shape (20, 50)
           and a linearly spaced k_distances array from 0 to 1. Set
           dk = 1e-15 (effectively zero), so the Gaussian kernel
           collapses to a delta function and the convolution should
           be the identity operation.
        2. **Apply broadening**: Call ``apply_momentum_broadening`` with
           the near-zero dk.
        3. **Compare**: Assert the result is element-wise close to the
           original intensity within atol=1e-3.

        **Expected assertions**

        The broadened intensity equals the input to within 1e-3,
        confirming the correct identity limit when the broadening
        width vanishes.

        Notes
        -----
        1. **Setup**: Create a 2D intensity map (50 x 10) that is zero
           everywhere except at k-index 25, where it is 1.0 across all
           energy channels. This represents a delta-like feature in
           k-space.
        2. **Apply broadening**: Call ``apply_momentum_broadening`` with
           dk=0.1, which should spread the peak to neighbouring
           k-points via the Gaussian kernel.
        3. **Check peak reduction**: Assert the peak value at index 25
           is reduced below 1.0 (the original delta height).
        4. **Check neighbour activation**: Assert that the immediately
           adjacent k-points (indices 24 and 26) have positive
           intensity, confirming the peak has been broadened.

        **Expected assertions**

        The peak is reduced and neighbours are activated, confirming
        that the Gaussian convolution physically smooths sharp
        k-space features as expected from finite analyser resolution.

        The total intensity is conserved to within 10% relative
        tolerance. Perfect conservation is not expected due to
        edge effects (truncation of the Gaussian kernel at the
        boundaries of the k-grid), but approximate conservation
