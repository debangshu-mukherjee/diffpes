"""Tests for orbital angular momentum calculation.

Extended Summary
----------------
Exercises :func:`diffpes.simul.compute_oam`. Verifies that the output
array has shape (K, B, A, 3) with channels [p_oam, d_oam, total_oam],
that all values are finite, and that the third channel equals the sum
of the first two. All test logic and assertions are documented in the
docstrings of each test class and method.
