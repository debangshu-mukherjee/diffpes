"""Validate Gaunt coefficient table.

Extended Summary
----------------
The tests validate the precomputed Gaunt coefficient table for angular
coupling in dipole matrix elements. Gaunt coefficients encode the integral
of three spherical harmonics over the unit sphere. They enforce the dipole
selection rules ``Delta l = +/-1`` and ``Delta m = q``. The tests verify the
table shape and both selection rules. They also verify allowed transitions,
reproducible construction, real values, and the positive fundamental s-p
coupling.
