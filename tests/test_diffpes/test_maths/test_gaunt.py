"""Tests for Gaunt coefficient table.

Extended Summary
----------------
Validates the precomputed Gaunt coefficient table used for angular
coupling in dipole matrix elements.  The Gaunt coefficients
G(l, m, q, l', m') encode the integral of three spherical harmonics
over the unit sphere and enforce dipole selection rules (Delta l = +/-1,
Delta m = q).  Tests verify the table shape, the Delta-l and Delta-m
selection rules, nonzero values for allowed transitions (s->p, p->s,
p->d), reproducibility of the build procedure, real-valuedness of all
entries, and a known positive value for the fundamental s-p coupling.
