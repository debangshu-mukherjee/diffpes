"""Reproduce a certified forward result from resolved artifacts.

Extended Summary
----------------
The runner resolves normalized inputs and the recorded result at the eager I/O
boundary. It executes the exact registered model and compares the resulting
PyTree numerically. A successful report is resolver-backed evidence; a stored
checksum alone is not a reproduction claim.

Routine Listings
----------------
:func:`reproduce_forward`
    Re-execute a registered model and compare its recorded result.

    """Re-execute a registered model and compare its recorded result.

    The runner resolves one normalized input and one separately stored result.

    :see: :class:`~.test_reproduction.TestReproduceForward`

    Implementation Logic
    --------------------
    1. **Resolve and re-execute**::

           reproduced_value = registered.executor(inputs)

       Exact registry lookup binds the rerun to the certificate model.
    2. **Compare numerical leaves**::

           absolute = jnp.abs(actual_flat - expected_flat)

       The report stores maximum absolute and relative errors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    certificate : ForwardCertificate
        Certificate with one normalized-input and one result artifact.
    resolver : ArtifactResolver
        Eager resolver for both normalized artifacts.
    tolerance : float
        Nonnegative absolute and relative comparison tolerance. Default 1e-10.

    Returns
    -------
    report : ReproductionReport
        Numerical comparison and reproduced result identity.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If required artifact roles or result tree structure are inconsistent.

    Notes
    -----
    The comparison uses ``tolerance`` for both the absolute and relative terms.
    Each leaf must satisfy ``absolute <= tolerance * (1 + abs(expected))``.
