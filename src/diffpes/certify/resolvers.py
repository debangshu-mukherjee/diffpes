"""Resolve certificate artifacts and verify external evidence.

Extended Summary
----------------
Resolvers operate at the eager I/O boundary. They return normalized scientific
content and may also return exact source bytes. The module checks both forms
against their separate non-security CRC32 identities. No resolver participates
in a traced physics calculation.

Routine Listings
----------------
:func:`filesystem_artifact_resolver`
    Resolve a byte-valued artifact from its local locator.
:func:`mapping_artifact_resolver`
    Build a deterministic resolver from normalized in-memory values.
:func:`resolve_artifact`
    Resolve and validate one referenced artifact.
:func:`verify_evidence`
    Verify referenced artifacts and recorded numerical residuals.
