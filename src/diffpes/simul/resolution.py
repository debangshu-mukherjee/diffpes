"""Momentum resolution broadening for ARPES simulations.

Extended Summary
----------------
Applies a Gaussian convolution along the k-axis to simulate the
finite angular acceptance of the ARPES electron analyser. The
convolution is implemented as a dense kernel matrix multiply,
which is efficient for typical k-point counts and fully
JAX-differentiable.

Routine Listings
----------------
:func:`apply_momentum_broadening`
    Convolve I(k, E) with a Gaussian in k-space.

Notes
-----
The kernel matrix has shape ``(K, K)`` and is built from the
cumulative k-path distances, so it correctly handles non-uniform
k-point spacing. All operations are JIT-compilable and support
``jax.grad`` with respect to the broadening width ``dk``.

    r"""Convolve I(k, E) with a Gaussian in k-space.

    Simulates the finite angular (momentum) resolution of an ARPES
    analyser by applying a Gaussian convolution along the k-axis.
    This smears sharp spectral features in momentum, mimicking the
    experimental point-spread function in the angular direction.

    In a real ARPES experiment, the finite angular acceptance of the
    electron analyser and the finite spot size of the photon beam
    lead to a momentum-space resolution function. This is well
    approximated by a Gaussian of width ``dk`` (in inverse
    Angstroms). The convolution is implemented as a matrix multiply
    with a normalized Gaussian kernel, which is efficient and
    JAX-differentiable.

    Implementation Logic
    --------------------
    1. **Guard the Gaussian width**::

           safe_dk: Float[Array, ""] = jnp.maximum(dk_arr, EPS)

       This guard prevents division by zero. A zero width produces an
       effectively diagonal kernel.

    2. **Build the Gaussian kernel**::

           kernel: Float[Array, " K K"] = jnp.exp(
               -0.5 * scaled_distances**2
           )

       Each matrix element measures the Gaussian overlap between two
       k-points. The cumulative distances support nonuniform spacing.

    3. **Normalize each row**::

           kernel = safe_divide(kernel, row_sum)

       The normalization preserves the spectral weight at each output
       k-point. The safe division also protects an empty numerical row.

    4. **Apply the kernel**::

           broadened: Float[Array, "K E"] = kernel @ intensity

       The matrix product applies the momentum response independently to
       every energy column.

    Parameters
    ----------
    intensity : Float[Array, "K E"]
        ARPES intensity map with shape ``(n_kpoints, n_energies)``.
    k_distances : Float[Array, " K"]
        Cumulative k-path distances of shape ``(n_kpoints,)``,
        in inverse Angstroms. Must be monotonically increasing.
    dk : ScalarFloat
        Gaussian broadening standard deviation in inverse Angstroms.
        Typical experimental values range from 0.01 to 0.05.

    Returns
    -------
    broadened : Float[Array, "K E"]
        Momentum-broadened intensity map, same shape as ``intensity``.

    Notes
    -----
    The kernel matrix is dense ``(K, K)`` and fully traced by JAX,
    so this function supports ``jax.grad`` with respect to ``dk``
    and ``intensity``. For very large numbers of k-points, memory
    usage scales as ``O(K^2)``.
