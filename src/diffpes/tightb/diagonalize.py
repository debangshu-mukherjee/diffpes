"""Differentiable band diagonalization and VASP adapter.

Extended Summary
----------------
Wraps ``jnp.linalg.eigh`` with vmap over k-points to produce
a ``DiagonalizedBands`` PyTree from a ``TBModel``. Also provides
an adapter to convert VASP ``BandStructure`` + ``OrbitalProjection``
to the same interface.

----------------
:func:`diagonalize_single_k`
    Diagonalize H(k) at a single k-point.
:func:`diagonalize_tb`
    Diagonalize a TB model at all k-points.
:func:`vasp_to_diagonalized`

    Extended Summary
    ----------------
    Delegates to ``jnp.linalg.eigh``, which is the standard LAPACK-style
    Hermitian eigensolver.  ``eigh`` is used (not ``eig``) because the
    Hamiltonian is guaranteed Hermitian by construction, which ensures
    real eigenvalues and an orthonormal eigenvector basis.

    ``jnp.linalg.eigh`` returns eigenvalues in **ascending** order and
    eigenvectors as **columns** of the returned matrix: that is,
    ``eigenvectors[:, i]`` is the eigenvector corresponding to
    ``eigenvalues[i]``.  This column-eigenvector convention is the
    LAPACK/NumPy/JAX standard but differs from some physics textbooks
    that store eigenvectors as rows.  The caller (``diagonalize_tb``)
    transposes to a band-major layout after vmapping.

    This function is intentionally thin -- a one-liner around ``eigh``
    -- so that it can be individually tested, mocked, or replaced with
    a custom differentiable eigensolver if needed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    H_k : Complex[Array, "O O"]
        Hermitian Hamiltonian matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    eigenvalues : Float[Array, " O"]
        Eigenvalues in ascending order.
    eigenvectors : Complex[Array, "O O"]
        Eigenvector columns (eigenvectors[:, i] is the i-th).

    Notes
    -----
    JAX provides analytical gradients through ``eigh`` via implicit
    differentiation of the eigenvalue equation, so
    ``jax.grad(lambda p: eigenvalues(p).sum())`` works out of the box.
    Degenerate eigenvalues can cause numerical instability in the
    backward pass; this is a known JAX limitation.

    """Diagonalize a TB model at all k-points.

    Builds H(k) for each k-point and diagonalizes via
    ``jnp.linalg.eigh``. Both operations are vmapped and
    fully differentiable with respect to ``tb_model.hopping_params``.

    Extended Summary
    ----------------
    Internally a closure ``_build_and_diag`` is defined that captures
    the model parameters (hopping amplitudes, indices, lattice vectors)
    and maps a single k-point to its ``(eigenvalues, eigenvectors)``
    pair.  ``jax.vmap`` is then applied over the leading k-point axis,
    so the entire band structure is computed in one vectorized call
    without Python loops.

    After vmapping, the eigenvector array has shape ``(K, O, O)`` in
    the column-eigenvector convention of ``eigh`` (i.e.
    ``evecs[k, :, b]`` is band ``b`` at k-point ``k``).  A transpose
    ``(0, 2, 1)`` converts this to the band-major convention
    ``(K, B, O)`` where ``evecs[k, b, :]`` gives the orbital
    coefficients of band ``b`` at k-point ``k``.  This layout matches
    the ``DiagonalizedBands.eigenvectors`` contract used by the rest
    of the ARPYES pipeline (projections, matrix elements, spectral
    function).

    The Fermi energy is set to 0.0 by default because bare
    tight-binding models have no absolute energy reference.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tb_model : TBModel
        Tight-binding model.
    kpoints : Float[Array, "K 3"]
        k-points in fractional coordinates.

    Returns
    -------
    bands : DiagonalizedBands
        Diagonalized electronic structure.

    Notes
    -----
    Because ``jax.vmap`` traces the function once and broadcasts over
    the batch dimension, the number of k-points does not affect
    compilation time -- only runtime.  The full forward + backward
    pass (eigenvalues and their gradients with respect to hopping
    parameters) is differentiable end-to-end.

    """Convert VASP BandStructure + OrbitalProjection to DiagonalizedBands.

    VASP PROCAR gives ``|c_{k,b,orb}|^2``, not the complex
    coefficients. This adapter uses ``sqrt(|c|^2)`` with positive
    sign as an approximation. Phase information is lost.

    The orbital projections are summed over atoms and mapped to
    the orbital basis ordering.

    Extended Summary
    ----------------
    VASP's PROCAR file provides site- and orbital-projected squared
    moduli ``|c_{k,b,atom,orb}|^2`` for each eigenstate.  Because
    the complex phase of each coefficient is discarded during the VASP
    projection, it is **not possible** to recover the true complex
    eigenvectors from PROCAR data alone.  This adapter applies the
    simplest possible approximation: it takes ``sqrt(|c|^2)`` with a
    uniformly **positive** sign, yielding purely real, non-negative
    approximate coefficients.

    The approximation is exact for any observable that depends only
    on the modulus of the coefficients (e.g. orbital-resolved density
    of states), but it introduces errors in any quantity sensitive to
    relative phases between orbitals (e.g. interference terms in
    photoemission matrix elements).

    **Orbital mapping.** VASP stores projections in a fixed 9-orbital
    ordering for the s, p, and d channels::

        [s, py, pz, px, dxy, dyz, dz2, dxz, dx2 - y2]

    This differs from some standard orderings (e.g. the ``(l, m)``
    convention with m running from -l to +l).  The function maps from
    ``(l, m)`` quantum numbers in the ``OrbitalBasis`` to VASP's
    9-orbital column index via a lookup table.

    **Atom summation.** Before the orbital mapping, the projections are
    summed over the atom axis (axis 2), collapsing
    ``(K, B, A, 9) -> (K, B, 9)``.  This is correct when the
    ``OrbitalBasis`` describes a single composite orbital per
    ``(l, m)`` channel rather than per-atom resolution.

    **Normalization.** After taking the square root, each eigenvector
    (per k-point and band) is normalized so that
    ``sum_orb |c_{k,b,orb}|^2 = 1``.  A safe-division guard
    selects a zero vector with a zero gradient when all projections are
    zero (e.g. core states with no s/p/d weight).

    Parameters
    ----------
    bands : BandStructure
        VASP eigenvalues and k-points.
    orb_proj : OrbitalProjection
        VASP orbital projections of shape (K, B, A, 9).
    orbital_basis : OrbitalBasis
        Quantum number metadata defining which VASP orbital
        indices to use.
    phase_loss : Literal["warn", "ignore", "error"]
        Policy for handling lost phase information:
        - ``"warn"`` (default): emit a runtime warning.
        - ``"ignore"``: proceed silently.
        - ``"error"``: raise ``ValueError`` and abort.

    Returns
    -------
    diag : DiagonalizedBands
        Approximate diagonalized bands.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``phase_loss`` is invalid, is ``"error"``, or the orbital basis
        contains a channel outside the VASP nine-orbital set.

    Notes
    -----
    The VASP 9-orbital ordering used here covers s, p, and d channels
    only.  f-orbital projections (l=3) are not supported and will raise
    a ``ValueError``.  If VASP was run with ``LORBIT=11`` or higher,
    the PROCAR contains all nine channels; ``LORBIT=10`` may omit
    per-m decomposition and is not compatible with this adapter.

    The resulting eigenvectors are cast to ``complex128`` for
    compatibility with the ``DiagonalizedBands`` type even though they
    are purely real (zero imaginary part).
