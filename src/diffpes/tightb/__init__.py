r"""Provide native tight-binding tools and ARPES-side adapters.

Extended Summary
----------------
The native tight-binding layer of DiffPES provides model construction,
Slater–Koster coupling, spin–orbit coupling, slabs, and degeneracy-safe
diagonalization as the plan series is implemented. It also consumes
``DiagonalizedBands`` from other electronic-structure sources.

This module retains:

- **ARPES-side adapters** that stay here permanently:
  ``vasp_to_diagonalized``, ``eigenvector_orbital_weights``,
  ``orbital_coefficients``.
- **Current fixtures, superseded by plan 04**:
  ``build_hamiltonian_k``, ``diagonalize_single_k``,
  ``diagonalize_tb``, ``make_1d_chain_model``,
  ``make_graphene_model``.

Routine Listings
----------------
:func:`vasp_to_diagonalized`
    Convert VASP ``BandStructure`` + ``OrbitalProjection`` to
    ``DiagonalizedBands`` (phase-less sqrt approximation).
:func:`eigenvector_orbital_weights`
    Compute orbital weights :math:`|c_{k,b,\\mathrm{orb}}|^2` from
    eigenvectors.
:func:`orbital_coefficients`
    Return raw complex orbital coefficients (identity accessor).
:func:`build_hamiltonian_k`
    (Legacy) Build the Bloch Hamiltonian H(k) at a single k-point.
:func:`diagonalize_single_k`
    (Legacy) Diagonalize a Hermitian Hamiltonian at one k-point.
:func:`diagonalize_tb`
    (Legacy) Diagonalize a ``TBModel`` at all k-points (vmapped).
:func:`make_1d_chain_model`
    (Legacy) Create a one-orbital 1D chain ``TBModel``.
:func:`make_graphene_model`
    (Legacy) Create a two-orbital honeycomb graphene ``TBModel``.
